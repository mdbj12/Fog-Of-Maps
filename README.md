Welcome to the first step into 'Game-ify'-ing your life!
Still under development!!!

Remember to change Host in App.py to your own IP address
Also App.jsx, Homescreen.jsx, Login.jsx, UserDetailsScreen.jsx (Change these IP addresses as well in the fetch 'http://{insert IP address}:5556')

App is currently running on port 5556

The main idea of this app is to allow you to be able to Travel and see a map on your mobile device that is covered in fog!

How can you open it up?
As a user, allow it to track your data (No data will be saved!), and it will open up the layer of fog only in places you have been to.
